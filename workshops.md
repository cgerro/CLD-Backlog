# Workshops

### Context

You are employed by a Swiss small/medium business making heavy use of information technology. Your boss is intrigued by cloud computing. He has read that it allows companies like yours to benefit from IT infrastructure that until recently only the big players, like Nestlé, Novartis, UBS, or Crédit Suisse could afford.

Your boss asks that you investigate, in a small group of colleagues, a cloud service or cloud-related technology that could be of interest to your company. He wants you to prepare a presentation, for him and the product development team, that explains the service/technology. He also wants you to develop an application showing the benefits in a small proof-of-concept. You are asked to demo the proof of concept in the second part of your presentation.

### Introductions

* Form a group of 5 students and declare it in Cyberlearn. To avoid schedule conflicts, all members of the group must be in the same class.
* Select your preferred topic and a second and third choice. In Teams, channel _Cours_, tab _Workshop_, put your three choices into the column corresponding to your group. Put a value of `1` into the cell corresponding to your first choice, `2` for your second choice, `3` for your third choice. When all groups have declared their choices the professor will resolve any conflicts.
* Schedule for the remainder of the course, [see the roadmap](roadmap.md).

### Presentation arrangements

* Give a live presentation of maximum 15 minutes (theoretical part and demo of proof-of-concept), followed by questions (3 minutes).
* Deliver your chart deck before the workshop for distribution to the class.
* Prepare a one-page summary of your topic for distribution to the class.
* Explain globally your topic. Recall that your audience consists of application architects, developers, and testers, but also business people (your boss). Don't forget to discuss the cost and strategic questions.
* For the proof-of-concept choose a practical application that illustrates well your topic.
* Give general recommendations when it makes sense to use the cloud service/technology and when it doesn't.
* Give pointers to references for further detailed information and explanations.
* You will have several sessions for preparation. During these sessions, you can ask the professor to assist you in the preparation of the presentation and proof of concept.
